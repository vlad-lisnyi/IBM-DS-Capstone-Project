# Background
Europe with its Eurozone is a perfect place for people who likes work travelling. My friend, Bart, currently is living in Warsaw, Poland and looking to move to some other city in Europe that is as comfortable as Warsaw but with higher income. I think Bart is not alone with such idea in mind, hence categorizing European cities by similarities is great topic that I might use myself as well.

# Idea
The goal here is to build a clustering model to group European cities based on certain parameters. Leveraging Foursquare API I gathered top cities venues, because variety of the restaurants and places you can go is one of the important factors feeling comfortable in the city. Also, the important factor is weather, even though there is plenty of restaurants out there if its showring outdoor. I know Bart likes the weather in Warsaw, hence I gathered some main weather statistics for each city. And of course, Bart is looking for city with higher income, GDP per capita as one of the main indicators of higher salaries is important indicator.
